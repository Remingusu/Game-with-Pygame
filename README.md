A project using the *[pygame](https://github.com/pygame/)* library. The aim is to kill as many enemies as possible without dying, using waves of meteorites.

This project is a copy-paste of *[Graven's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J8wWxbAdFg&list=PLMS9Cy4Enq5KsM7GJ4LHnlBQKTQBV8kaR)* tutorial (French Tutorial). It's a **learning** project.
